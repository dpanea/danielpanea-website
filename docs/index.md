## About me

Hi! I‚Äôm Daniel Panea, a data scientist and AI engineer with a background in theoretical physics and a passion for intelligent systems that work in the real world. I help companies move beyond experimentation and deploy AI solutions that are modular, efficient, and fully under their control.

Whether you're trying to eliminate repetitive work with automation or integrate large language models into your existing tools, my mission is the same: deliver AI that‚Äôs reliable, privacy-conscious, and actually improves your bottom line.

My journey started with a PhD in theoretical physics and led me into high-performance computing, machine learning, and eventually AI engineering. I‚Äôve spent the last 3+ years building custom algorithms, data pipelines and AI/ML systems across the semiconductor industry, geolocation, education, and enterprise automation. Always with a focus on data sovereignty and open infrastructure.

## Why work with me?

Here's what sets me apart and how I can help drive value for your business:
