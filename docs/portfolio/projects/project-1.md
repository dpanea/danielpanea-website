## Challenge 

Mark My Words is an Australian EdTech startup which is developing an AI-powered platform for teachers to track assignments, provide detailed feedback, and help students succeed. The challenge was to further develop and refine the core intelligence behind the platform providing an enhanced user experience.

## My Approach

As part of the machine learning and AI team, I worked on implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation models to extract meaningful context from student essays and knowledge sources, improving the depth and relevance of the feedback. I built synthetic data generation pipelines to fine-tune our embedding and generative models, making them more robust and adaptable to diverse writing styles. Additionally, I developed endpoints to integrate these AI capabilities with the frontend application, enabling seamless, real-time interaction between students, teachers, and the feedback system.

## Results
The platform is now capable of processing entire sets of student writing in a short time frame, providing immediate, detailed, and personalized feedback. Feedbacks are anchored in relevant context through RAG integration and are specialized and age-appropriate through fine-tuning.

## Technical Expertise
This project brings together advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques, including RAG architectures, transformer models, sentence embeddings, and large language model fine-tuning. The latter also involved synthetic data generation for model training. FastAPI and asynchronous endpoints were used to ensure reliable backend performance and smooth integration.
